each terminal token returned by the scanner has a semantic value associated with it.
we may us or ignore the semantic value at our discretion


In the flex-generated scanner:
const char* yytext; //this character array is of the text that actually matched the regular expression
int yylval; //his integer holds the semantic value. It will ultimately be more complicated than
a simple integer. But for the RPN calculator, a simple integer satisfies.
